# Food Desert Analysis for Allegheny County
- the attached Jupyter notebook is my submission for the final capstone class for my Master's in Data Science at Eastern University
- the factors I used to create a classication model for predicting food desert status in each census tract in Allegheny County were:
  + median family income
  + poverty rate
  + percentage of:
    - seniors
    - SNAP recipients
    - white
    - black
    - asian
    - native hawaiian or other pacific islander
    - american indian or alaskan native
    - multiracial
    - hispanic or latino
  + obesity rate
  + diabetes and hypertension comorbidity rate
  + number of fast food restaurants and convenience stores (unhealthy food options)
  + number of supermarkets (healthy food options)
  + walk score
  + educational attainment separated by:
    - high school dropout
    - high school only completed
    - associates degree or "some college"
    - bachelors degree or higher

This project was an analysis of economic and health factors and their relationship to food desert status in the greater Pittsburgh area of Allegheny County.
I collected data from the Western Pennsylvania Research Data Center, the US Census, and the USDA to complete my features dataframe.

I found that educational attainment and other factors related to income where much more correlated to food desert status than any of the health factors studied.
